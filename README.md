# Rust Quick Guide

This will be a quick guide to learning Rust. I'm beginning work at the date of this commit (10/23/23) and hope to have it complete by the end of 2023.

The Rust docs are very good but somewhat verbose. I like documentation that is simple enough to be a one-pager. I aim for [the famous Smalltalk postcard](https://richardeng.medium.com/syntax-on-a-post-card-cb6d85fabf88).

# The Guide

The below text is valid Rust code. It is a copy of the code in the src directory.

``` rust
/* Comment blocks start with slash-star,
   and end with star-slash. */
// Line comments begin with a double slash.

/* Rust was inspired by the ML family of languages. As such, variables are not, by default, variable.
```
